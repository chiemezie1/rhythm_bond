## Next Steps

1. **Update the Genre Pages**: The genre directory should be updated to use YouTube tracks instead of traditional music genres.
2. **Implement User Data Persistence**: Ensure all user actions (recently played, favorites, etc.) are saved to the MySQL database.
3. **Fix Social Feed API**: Update the social feed API to handle comment likes correctly.
4. **Implement AI Recommendations**: Add AI-powered music recommendations based on user preferences.
5. **Enhance User Experience**: Improve the UI/UX with better loading states, error handling, and animations.
